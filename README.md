# AsmMe

A parody implementation of `DaringCuteSeal/AskMe` in x86_64 assembly (linked against libc)...that is not compliant.

## Rules & guidelines

since this program aims to be as minimal as possible, some libc functions will not be allowed.

 * All `printf` and `scanf` variants,
 * `puts`,

Things like memory allocation may be done with `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
